### Motivation

**Javascript** is one of most popular programming languages. Earlier Javascript was only used for designing interactive web pages but now it is used for Full Stack Development. Out of number of methods of running Javascript is through web browser, in which we interact with elements of the page.When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

**HTML** continues to be a useful content expression language that powers Web growth. It is now time for HTML to mature and grow to support both content driven and layout driven forms in the sensate spaces as well. In an ideal world HTML has a simpler more coherant syntax with well specified content flow semantics. In that same world, non conflicting custom tag sets would permit the capture of unique application structure and permit it to be presented in a variety of formats constrained to present the information content in a manner best perceived by the content consumer. This would include the capability to select precision rendering in the sensate spaces (visual, auditory, or tactile,or smell!?) driven either by a content or layout driven forms. A dynamically drivable precision graphic expression capability providing a means to identify and expose graphics structure along with document structure provides the basis for superb graphic layout, but also provides the key to render the graphics in other sensate spaces as well. To achieve this kind of high utility growth and permit standardized interpreted semantic tag sets, HTML should be driven to align with the work that opens up these new vistas, that is, XML. It is time to plan an enhancement of HTML to achieve these goals.

What is **CSS**?

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
- External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
